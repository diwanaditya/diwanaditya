# Aditya Diwan

Software Engineering student specializing in systems programming, backend development, and high-reliability tools. I focus on building efficient, modular, and maintainable software using strong foundations in computer science: Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Database Systems.

I enjoy designing system utilities, real-time monitoring tools, API-driven applications, and command-line interfaces that emphasize performance, clarity, and clean architecture.

## About Me

I approach engineering with a developer-first mindset: understand the system, design the architecture, implement with clarity, and iterate with precision. My work is centered around:

- Backend development using Python, C, and SQL  
- System-level utilities, real-time monitoring, and OS-aware tools  
- REST API development and data pipeline construction  
- Clean architecture, modular design, and maintainable codebases  
- Continuous improvement through testing, debugging, and profiling  

I am currently refining my skills in system design, scalability fundamentals, and deeper computer science concepts to prepare for software engineering roles at high-performance technical organizations.
