Here are some active projects on my GitHub — click to explore.

1. [NetScope](https://github.com/diwanaditya/NetScope) —NetScope is a terminal-based tool to inspect ASNs, IP addresses, and ISPs. It provides comprehensive network intelligence in a single CLI report using multiple reliable data source.
2. [PacGhost](https://github.com/diwanaditya/PacGhost) — Pacghost is a fun little terminal-based game I hacked together pretty quickly. It started as a draft experiment, but I decided to clean it up and put it here - because why not?
3. [skullsays](https://github.com/diwanaditya/skullsays) — skullsays is a lightweight and fun command-line tool that displays text messages with a horror skull ASCII art.

**In development:** SOC — Next‑Gen Threat Intelligence & Honeypot Engine (design, honeypots, SIEM‑style collection, and AI‑powered reporting).
