## About me

I build, break, and secure networked systems. I focus on full‑stack development, offensive security, API integrations, and practical tools that help defenders and researchers understand network behaviour. I run CTFs, hunt bugs on bug‑bounty platforms, and teach through workshops.

* 🔭 Currently focused on: **threat detection**, **network analysis**, **API integrations**, and **machine learning**.
* 💻 Primary roles: **Full‑stack developer**, **ethical hacker**, **API integrator**, and **CTF challenge creator**.
* ⚡ Learning: deeper ML concepts and their application to security analytics.

## Skills & tools

* Programming & frameworks: Python (Flask, TensorFlow, and many other libraries), JavaScript, and modern full‑stack frameworks
* Web development: Full‑stack web applications, REST APIs, API integration
* Cybersecurity: Ethical hacking, web app security (XSS, vuln hunting, Bug Bounty workflows)
* Networking: Network analysis, honeypots, and system troubleshooting
* DevOps & tooling: Docker, CI/CD workflows, Linux scripting & automation
* Machine learning: Fundamentals + practical applications (currently learning and applying)

## Selected projects

Here are some active projects on my GitHub — click to explore.

1.[System Inspector](https://github.com/diwanaditya/SysInspector) - System Inspector is an advanced system and network monitoring application built with Python (Tkinter + psutil). It provides a visually structured and interactive dashboard to observe CPU, memory, disk, network, and system performance metrics in real-time. The tool is designed to simulate the monitoring perspective of a System Operations Center (SOC), allowing users to analyze system health, detect unusual activity, and generate reports — all through a dynamic GUI interface.

2.[NetScope](https://github.com/diwanaditya/NetScope) — NetScope is a terminal-based tool to inspect ASNs, IP addresses, and ISPs. It provides comprehensive network intelligence in a single CLI report using multiple reliable data source.

3.[PacGhost](https://github.com/diwanaditya/PacGhost) — Pacghost is a fun little terminal-based game I hacked together pretty quickly. It started as a draft experiment, but I decided to clean it up and put it here - because why not?

4.[skullsays](https://github.com/diwanaditya/skullsays) — skullsays is a lightweight and fun command-line tool that displays text messages with a horror skull ASCII art.

**In development:** SOC — Next‑Gen Threat Intelligence & Honeypot Engine (design, honeypots, SIEM‑style collection, and AI‑powered reporting).
